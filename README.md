   - This project aims to provide a low-cost solution for remote physiotherapy sessions using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense board to recognize gestures made by the user.

5. [Smart Home](https://github.com/AWESOME04/Smart-Home)

![Final Proteus Design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102630199/226955224-1d36b5e5-7611-4945-b828-1d73d479db2a.jpg)

   - The project involves integrating sensors, actuators, and controllers to detect data from the environment and trigger actions on different devices.

7. [Arduino Game Controller](https://github.com/AWESOME04/Arduino-Game-Controller)

   - In this project, I made a game controller using Arduino Nano BLE 33 Sense, which has an onboard proximity sensor. I played video games using the Gesture Sensor (APDS9960).

9. [Facial Recognition](https://github.com/AWESOME04/Facial-Recognition-Using-Python-OpenCV)

![f8c70ac378](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102630199/228613628-f60ee6ee-c4b4-42d7-8fa6-1590e29bb502.jpg)

   - This is a project that uses Python and OpenCV to perform facial detection and recognition. The project includes a script that captures video from a webcam, detects faces in each frame, and recognizes them if they are already known to the system.
